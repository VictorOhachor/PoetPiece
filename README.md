<h1 align="center">PoeticMan</h1>

 A web application for the purpose composing and publishing poems. Though it started as a small project, it is gradually growing.



## Features
➕ Added:

- Pagination to show_poems route
- Edit and Delete functionality to poems
- Ability to navigate/filter poems by categories
- An is_admin decorator to protect some routes from normal user access

❌ Removed:

- Authentication protection on the show_poems route

✅ Improved:

- Overall code structure

🔜 Coming Soon:

- Will refactor the source code to use Flask BluePrints that I learnt recently.
- Writing unittests (I am yet to learn how this is done in Flask).
- Add a feature update page that notifies users of new feature.
- Add a learning page where articles focused on poetry will be curated.

I will avoid adding any feature that involves working with images and videos due to limited storage on the server.
